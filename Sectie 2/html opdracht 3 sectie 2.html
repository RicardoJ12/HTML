    <h1>Battle Royale</h1>
    <p>
      Massive maps. 60-player matches. An ever-shrinking Ring. Will your squad
      win it all?

    <h1>STAY INSIDE THE RING</h1>

    <p>
      The Ring is always closing and you won't last long on the outside. As the
      Ring gets smaller, you'll be forced into more encounters with the
      remaining squads. So make sure you have the right loadout to take them on.

    <h1>GET YOUR LOOT ON</h1>

    <p>
      You'll drop in with basic gear. Explore the map -and Death Boxes of fallen
      foes- to find better equipment. If you're going to survive, you'll need
      it.
    </p>

    <h1>LAST SQUAD STANDING</h1>

    <p>
      Whether you're in Duos or Trios, the goal is the same: to be the last
      squad left alive. But death isn't always permanent --keep your squad in
      the fight with the help of Respawn Beacons.
