    <h1>ARENAS</h1>
    <p>
      Arenas are the underground, unsanctioned fight clubs on the Arenas. Fight
      to the finish in this action-packed 3v3 round-based game mode. Pick your
      loadout, and sharpen your skills on bespoke maps where thereâ€™s no room for
      luck.

    <h1>ROUND-BASED COMBAT</h1>
    <p>
      The first squad to win three rounds (with a two round margin) is
      victorious. If the squads are deadlocked in a 4-4 tie, the match goes to
      sudden death.
    </p>
    <h1>CUSTOMIZE YOUR LOADOUT</h1>
    <p>
      Pick your loadout each round and earn and spend Crafting Materials to
      improve your options between rounds. Your equipment doesn't carry over
      from round to round, but Crafting Materials can be saved up to purchase
      better equipment in later rounds.
